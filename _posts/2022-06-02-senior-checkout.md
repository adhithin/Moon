## Computer Science Skills 

- Frontend: this trimester was my first attempt at actual frontend code and thymeleaf, since I usually take backend. 

- Uploads: worked on the technical, was able to successfully integrate code.  

- Database: worked on databases, learned how they work, CRUD (in java this time). 

### Overall Reflection: 

## Life Skills 

### Consistency 

I feel like I've gotten better at being consistent with coding. I've made commits everyday that I was in class.

It's helped me develop and understand consistency - the more you do something on a consistent basis, the better you'll get. I definitely want to keep applying this skill for computer science, and keep learning how to code and make sure I have the fundamentals of code down.

### Getting organized (senioritis?) 

Compared to last year, I wasn't as organized. I was definitely lacking in organization, and struggled to stay on top of my work. While there were definitely a lot of factors that played into this (trip to India, stress, college apps), it's not an excuse. Computer Science has definitely taught me to stay on top of my work, and manage my schedule since coding is a long process; there's always a lot of unexpected errors that can come up and take time to resolve. 

### Not being afraid to ask questions 

Sometimes, I get afraid to ask questions. I've got questions about things I feel like I'm expected to know, and sometimes feel scared that questions are dumb, or that I should know. Because of that, I'm scared to ask questions. 

### Don't eat the watermelon in one bite 

I've definitely gotten better with this one in the past few years. Back in AP CSP, I took on a lot more work than I could handle, so I underdelivered. This year, I think I got better with understanding how much work and skill I was capable of, but at the same time, I kind of took on less work than I could.
