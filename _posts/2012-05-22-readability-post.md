<a id="#u1" > ### Faculty Lecture 1: Primitive Data Types in Java </a>


What is an actual computer program 

An actual computer program takes data, manipulates data, and outputs symbolic data. This happens because there's a set of very specific instructions telling the computer what to do. These instructions are the program. 

In java, there’s a lot of different ways to represent information. These are called primitive data types. There’s 8 of them, but we’re focusing on two. 

Int is for integers, such as whole numbers. 

Double is for decimal numbers, or numbers that have a fraction. Double stands for double precision floating type number. 

Declaring an integer accomplishes creating a variable. It’s like a box we’re going to put integers in. We’ve assigned the value to the number as well. It gives the variable a name. 

If we’re declaring a whole number as a double, it’s customary to write 4.0, for example, instead of just 4. 

If you add a double and an int together, that value must be assigned as a double. If it’s assigned as an int, the program won’t run. If you do, you may lose precision because int will cut of the other values. 

There’s 4 different types of integers in java. Byte short int long, and our 2 doubles are float and double. 

But information isn’t always numeric - we have text, and other stuff. 

This includes boolean, bool which is for true and false statements. 

We have a character primitive type, char, for different characters. Characters use 2 bytes, which is 16 bits (there are 8 bits in 1 byte). A boolean is about 1 byte. 

Strings are not here, because Strings are not a primitive data type. They’re a bit more sophisticated.
