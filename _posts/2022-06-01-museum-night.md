### Our Project

Our project had a lot of people coming to see it, and a lot of APUSH students seemed quite interested in the project. We showed the audience the database of notes, how it worked, as well as how to create an account, and our security features. 

Here's our commercial, which I worked on:

### Individual Work 

I tried to work on the front end, but it didn't come together in time for n@tm. 

Worked on uploads. 


### Project 1 

#### What was it about? 

Ridhima, Kira, Rini, and Natasha worked on a project to display night at the museum projects virtually. They wanted to allow students to upload their artwork and help them stand out. Their sponsor was Mr. Coleman. 


#### What did I learn? 

They seemed to have a lot of good security features, and definitely understood their upload technicals. They took a look at file size, and what pictures they could upload. This was interesting to see, since our project focused on uploading pdf files. I was also interested in their display and security features, since there might need to be a restriction on who can upload pictures on the site. 

#### Pictures!
